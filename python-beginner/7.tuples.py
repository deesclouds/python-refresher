# Tuples 

# how to create a tuple

coordinates = (4, 5)

# immutable means that it cannot be changed

print(coordinates[0]) # print out 4

# difference between a list and a tuple
# lists can be changed tuple cannot be changed

# in practical use cases use a tuple if the data will never change

# create a list of tuples
coordinates = [(4, 5), (6, 7), (80, 34)]
